        <h2>Working remotely in Ireland</h2>

        <p>
          The nature of work in Ireland has changed. In the last few years we have
          seen the resilient and adaptable way in which people have gone about their
          jobs in difficult circumstances. In the aftermath of the pandemic, many
          are keen to take advantage of new technologies, workflows and attitudes
          to employment. Increasingly, companies are starting to realise that how and
          where their employees work is not as important as once thought.
        </p>
        <p>
          This has lead to an explosion in the numbers of people who are taking a
          fresh look at their job and the new possibilities in how and where they
          can live and work. This shift to remote work represents a fundamental
          change which is unlikely to go away anytime soon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here you will find a guide to the best spots in Ireland to live and work
          remotely, as well as some recommended equipment and a newsletter to keep
          you up to date on the latest developments in working practices.

        <h2>Big Changes</h2>
        <p>
          As well as compiling a database of the best places to work remotely, we also surveyed remote employees to
          learn how thay have been affected by recent changes, and to see how they wish to work in the future.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            75% of people worked remotley during COVID
          </li>

          <li>
            54% had never worked remotely before the Pandemic
          </li>

          <li>
            95% intend to work remotely in the future, even if they have to switch jobs to achieve this
          </li>

          <li>
            91% agree that flexibilty in how work gets done is the biggest advantage

        <h2>The Results</h2>
        <p>We have conducted in-depth and detailed research on all the towns and
          cities in Ireland, and compiled a list of suitable locations. We then
          compared and contrasted each location using our database to see which
          potential locations would tick all the boxes for anyone looking to work
          remotely. The main criteria used are the price for buying or renting a house, the safety of the area and
          number of coffee shops available for your caffeine fix!</p>
