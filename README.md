# Note on commit history
There was a brief period during this project where Gitpod was offline, so I used my own local copy of VS Code on my laptop. When I Linked to Github and made my commits it did not authenticate them properly, and so it can appear that another user was making commits. I have contacted Student Care and one of the online tutors about this, who recommended including this explanation. If you have any concerns I can be contacted about this.
